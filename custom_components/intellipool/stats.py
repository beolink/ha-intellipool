"""Anonymous usage statistics for this integration.

Copy the file to custom_components/<domain>/stats.py and wire it in as
described in the backend repo. It sends one report per day to stats.rnet.se:
version, Home Assistant version, country as configured in Home Assistant
itself, entity counts, a few on/off flags and an approximate position rounded
to about 11 km. Never a name, an address, an exact position, a serial number,
an entity id or anything at a finer resolution than one day.

Reporting is on by default and is switched off in the integration's options.
Switching it off sends one last call that erases everything stored about this
particular installation.

What is collected, and why: https://stats.rnet.se/integritet
