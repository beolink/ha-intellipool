"""Anonymous usage statistics for this integration.

Copy the file to custom_components/<domain>/stats.py and wire it in as
described in the backend repo. It sends one report per day to stats.rnet.se:
version, Home Assistant version, country as configured in Home Assistant
itself, entity counts, a few on/off flags and an approximate position rounded
to about 11 km. Never a name, an address, an exact position, a serial number,
an entity id or anything at a finer resolution than one day.

Two things tie the picture together. ``ha_id`` is a hash of Home Assistant's
own instance id, so every beolink plugin on the same installation arrives at
the same value on its own, without talking to each other; the instance id
itself never leaves the house, and the server hashes the hash again before
storing it. And the report carries how many warnings and errors the
integration's own logger has written since the previous report: the counts
only, never a message.

Reporting is on by default and is switched off in the integration's options.
Switching it off sends one last call that erases everything stored about this
particular installation.

The reporter is armed once per config entry and kept in ``hass.data``, so it
outlives a set-up that does not finish. An integration whose device is
unreachable at start-up raises ConfigEntryNotReady and is retried by Home
Assistant for as long as the device stays away; if the reporter were tied to
that attempt, the installation would fall silent exactly while something is
wrong with it. Arm it before the first call that can raise, and stop it from
``async_unload_entry`` (which a failed attempt never reaches).
